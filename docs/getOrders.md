# getOrders

The method allows you to download orders from a specific date from the BaseLinker order manager. The order list can be limited using the filters described in the method parameters. A maximum of 100 orders are returned at a time.

It is recommended to download only confirmed orders (`get_unconfirmed_orders = false`). Unconfirmed orders may be incomplete. The user may be, for example, in the process of creating an order - it already exists in the database, but not all information is completed. Unconfirmed orders may contain only a partial list of products and may be changed soon. Confirmed orders usually do not change anymore and can be safely downloaded to an external system.

## Best Practices

The best way to download the ongoing orders is:
1. Collecting new order identifiers using `getJournalList`.

Or, using this method:
1. Setting the starting date and specifying it in the `date_confirmed_from` field
2. Processing of all received orders. If 100 orders are received, there may be even more to download.
3. Downloading the next package of orders by entering the value of the `date_confirmed` field from last downloaded order in the `date_confirmed_from` field. In order to avoid downloading the same orders value of `date_confirmed` should be increased by 1 second. This operation is repeated until you receive a package with less than 100 orders (this means that there are no more orders left to download).
4. Saving the `date_confirmed` last processed order. You can download orders from this date onwards so that you do not download the same order twice. It is not possible for an order to 'jump' into the database with an earlier confirmation date. This way you can be sure that all confirmed orders have been downloaded.

## Input Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `order_id` | int | (optional) Order identifier. Completing this field will download information about only one specific order. |
| `date_confirmed_from` | int | (optional) Date of order confirmation from which orders are to be collected. Format unix time stamp. |
| `date_from` | int | (optional) The order date from which orders are to be collected. Format unix time stamp. |
| `id_from` | int | (optional) The order ID number from which subsequent orders are to be collected. |
| `get_unconfirmed_orders` | bool | (optional, false by default) Download unconfirmed orders as well (this is e.g. an order from Allegro to which the customer has not yet completed the delivery form). Default is false. Unconfirmed orders may not be complete yet, the shipping method and price is also unknown. |
| `status_id` | int | (optional) The status identifier from which orders are to be collected. Leave blank to download orders from all statuses. |

| `filter_order_source_id` | int | (optional) Filtering of order lists by order source identifier, for instance "2523" (displays only orders come from order source defined in "filter_order_source" identified by given order source identifier). Filtering by order source indentifier requires "filter_order_source" to be set prior. The list of order source identifiers can be retrieved with `getOrderSources` method. |
| `filter_shop_order_id` | int | (optional) Shop Order identifier. Completing this field will download information about specific orders. |
| `include_custom_extra_fields` | bool | (optional, false by default) Download values of custom additional fields. |
